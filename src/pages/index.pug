    +project("April 2017", "This website", "#", "img/codeScreenshot.png", ["Web", "Shell scripts", "npm", "LESS", "CSS", "Pug"])
      p Created to explain and present my projects in a more practical manner that Github does.
      p Made from scratch, easily editable & hosted on Github.
      p This website is defined by meta-language such as LESS & Pug who compiles respectively to CSS & HTML. This allow the code to be as small as possible and very modular. Furthermore, when in development, I've added a watcher on some files to automatically launch the build process. In this way, there is no "build time" drawback.
      p Code strive to be minimal. This project permitted to aquaint myself with the relatively new CSS flexbox positionning system.

        | I always dreamed about a screen always on presenting some useful information. The low energy small laptop WM8650
        |
        a(href="#wm8650") from a previous project
        |
        | was a perfect device for this.
      p This device can't host an X server with good performance that's why a fancy way to create such a dashboard can be a terminal app. I've chosen the Go termui library to learn the Go language.
      p Extra, nobody likes to miss to train because it left just few minutes ago. Also, the general train status is important. When all trains are cancelled because of an outage, it's better to anticipate. Furthermore, everybody likes weather forecasts. That's why I wanted my app to display all those informations.
      p For this, this app fetches some information from the RATP & the Open Weather APIs.
      p The dashboard displays the following info :
      ul 
        li Trains status
        li Next trains
        li Next bus
        li General day information
        li Weather
          ul
            li Temperature
            li Cloud coverage
            li Wind speed
            li Rain
      p You can also control the house's light bulbs thanks to the Hue system.
      p This device is now used everyday and is very convenient. I never missed a bus or discovered a cancelled train while in the station!

      p This project was my third Android app but the first really useful: this app fetches and present the NASA's Picture of The Day.
      p I started this project for a school project intended to learn images gesture on Android. But instead of the dumb and useless app requested, I wanted to make this app usefull. Therefore I pushed the instructions further and came with this idea of presenting beautiful images (with gestures support of course) but along with other features. Such as:
      ul 
        li Fetch the last two Nasa Pictures of the Day
        li Create a date picker to view a past picture
        li Open the related NASA website
        li Share the app to your friends
        li Great UI?
      p This app has been great fun. I still have the app on my phone to learn space things and this app is often downloaded by people all around the globe.

      p My second Android App: kinda useful.
      p This app is a classic. A standard TODO app. This project permitted to learn the intent and activity objects in Android.

      p My first Android app.
      p This app permitted to discover the Android developpement that I always wanted to discover. I designed the UX to me as simple as possible. No button, the convertion is insteneous.

      p While friends were about to throw away this antique Android-only laptop (useless to them), I recovered this laptop challenging myself to install Linux on it.
      p I saw someone about to throw away an old Android laptop. And this is when you tweak every device.
      p First, this chineese small laptop had one of the first release of Android : Froyo. It's was painfully slow on this device but not usable not all: who support Android 2.2 nowadays?
      p So I decided to make it run Linux! The possibilities could be endless after that. This device use uboot as a bootloader and supports booting from an SD card. Luckily, the architecture armv5 is not unknow. I managed to find an great OS for it : ARM Arch Linux. Others had done this before but with older kernels. So I needed to cross compile a kernel, reboot by reboot, option by option to get this device up with the latest version of ARM Linux & the Kernel (4.7).
      p This has been great fun. I learned a ton of stuffs about the kernel and the ARM architecture. And more importantly, this device is now usefull! It has a fully working ethernet port, 3 USB ports, WIFI and a small screen and keyboard.

      p I love to tune everything to the perction for my usage. So, after hours on various things (Zsh, Git, etc) here's my dotfiles.
    +project("May 2016", "MiniVim", "https://github.com/sd65/MiniVim", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd65/MiniVim/master/Screenshot.png")
      p My first text editor was Sublime Text. I like it. However it's not a open-source software and can't run in terminals. I always knew about Vim & Emacs but wasn't appeal by the complexity and change of paradimgs.
      p That's why I manage Vim to behave like Sublime Text. The MiniVim project was born.
      p I spend hours creating the most awesome vim configuration I could. That was very instructive. I discovered Vim a lot. And now I use this configuration everyday at work or at home.
      p After Korben.info made a post about it, people took interest in the project and I had to manage it like a real small open-source projects: issues, pull-request, forks, etc. That's is my most sucecsful project yet.
    +project("May 2016", "Graf'hit.net", "https://github.com/sd65/New-Graf-hit", "")
      p For a school project, we had to realize a website. We don't wanted to be another useless website so we ask around the university who wanted a new website and the Graf'hit radio answered.
      p The school project was UX oriented. After discussing with the client, we decided to develop the website with Node.js that I knew well.
      p One interesting feature is the fact that you can navigate on the website without the current audio stream interupted.

      p I wanted to discover SVGs.
      p That's why I created this website recreating this old Windows XP screensaver which bounce a triangle accross the screen. Conclustion: SVGs are easy & fun.

      p Following my Human2Cat language, I wanted to be able to translate on the fly text in my browser. Furthermore, at that time, I never wrote an browser extension.
      p This project use the code of the project just bellow. When a text is selected you can add a popup wuth the text translated. You can also, while in a text field, translate on the fly the content.P
      p I discovered the chrome extension API which is quite good. This extension is published on the Chrome Extension Store, I'm happy.

      p Fascinated with cyphers, I wanted to create a small fun one.
      p This program can turn any text in a cat language. The, you can convert it back. It's not encrypted at all, it's basically just an fancy way to store 8 bits.
